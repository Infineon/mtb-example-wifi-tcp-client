# AnyCloud: TCP client

This code example demonstrates the implementation of a TCP client with PSoC™ 6 MCU with AIROC™ CYW43xxx Wi-Fi & Bluetooth® combo chips. The example establishes a connection with a remote TCP server and based on the command received from the TCP server, turns the user LED ON or OFF. Additionally, this code example can be configured to bring up the Wi-Fi device either in STA interface or in Soft AP interface mode.

This example uses the [Wi-Fi middleware core](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/wifi-mw-core) library of the AnyCloud SDK. This library enables Wi-Fi-based application development by bundling together various other libraries - FreeRTOS, Wi-Fi host driver (WHD), lwIP TCP/IP stack, Mbed TLS, and Secure sockets. The Secure sockets library provides an easy-to-use API by abstracting the network stack (lwIP) and the security stack (Mbed TLS).

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software setup

- Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

- Install a Python Interpreter if you don't have one. This code example is tested using [Python 3.7.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/).

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](http://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. Optionally, change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. Enter the local path in the **Application(s) Root Path** field to indicate where the application needs to be created.

   Applications that can share libraries can be placed in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool to easily create one or more ModusToolbox applications. See the "Project Creator Tools" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) for more details.

Alternatively, you can manually create the application using the following steps:

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder.

   On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox installation instead of a standard Windows command line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu.

   In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

   **Note:** The cloned application contains a default BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.mtb*) in the *deps* folder. Use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) (`make modlibs` command) to select and download a different BSP file, if required. If the selected kit does not have the required resources or is not [supported](#supported-kits-make-variable-target), the application may not work.

3. Import the required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

Various CLI tools include a `-h` option that prints help information to the terminal screen about that tool. For more details, see the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In Third-party IDEs</b></summary>

1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*.

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

</details>

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. The kit can be configured to run either as Wi-Fi STA interface mode or in AP interface mode. The interface mode is configured using  the `USE_AP_INTERFACE` macro defined in the *tcp_client.c* file. Based on the desired interface mode, do the following:

   **Kit in STA mode (default interface):**

   1. Set the `USE_AP_INTERFACE` macro to '0'. This is the default mode.

   2. Modify the `WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_PASSWORD`, and `WIFI_SECURITY_TYPE` macros to match with that of the Wi-Fi network credentials that you want to connect. These macros are defined in the *tcp_client.c* file. Ensure that the Wi-Fi network that you are connecting to is configured as a private network for the proper functioning of this example.

   **Kit in AP mode:**

   1. Set the `USE_AP_INTERFACE` macro to '1'.

   2. Update the `SOFTAP_SSID`, `SOFTAP_PASSWORD`, and `SOFTAP_SECURITY_TYPE` as desired. This step is optional.

   **Note:** CYSBSYSKIT-01 does not support AP mode and reserves UDP and TCP port numbers from 49152 to 57343.

3. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

4. Program the board using one of the following:


   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
      </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>


   **Note:** Before building the application, ensure that the *deps* folder contains the BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.lib*) corresponding to the TARGET. Execute the `make getlibs` command to fetch the BSP contents before building the application.

   After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that the text as shown in Figure 1 for STA mode and Figure 2 in AP mode is displayed on the UART terminal. Note that in STA mode, the Wi-Fi SSID and IP address assigned will be different based on the network that you have connected to; in AP mode, the AP credentials will be different based on your configuration in Step 2.

   **Figure 1. Wi-Fi connectivity status in STA mode**

   ![](images/tcp-client-sta-pre-connection.png)

   <br>

   **Figure 2. Wi-Fi connectivity status in AP mode**

   ![](images/tcp-client-ap-pre-connection.png)


5. Connect your computer to the Wi-Fi AP that you have configured in Step 2:

   - In STA mode: Connect the computer to the same AP to which the kit is connected.

   - In AP mode: Connect the computer to the kit's AP.

6. Open a command shell from the project directory and run the Python TCP server (*tcp_server.py*). In the command shell opened in the project directory, type in the following command:

   ```
   python tcp_server.py
   ```

   Make a note of the TCP server's IPv4 address.

   **Note:** Ensure that the firewall settings of your computer allow access to the Python software so that it can communicate with the TCP client. For more details on enabling Python access, refer to this [community thread](https://community.cypress.com/thread/53662).

   **Figure 3. TCP server IPv4 address**

   ![](images/tcp-server-ip-address.png)


7. From the UART terminal, enter the IPv4 address for the TCP server as noted in Step 6.

   For example, if the TCP server IPv4 address is 192.168.10.2, then enter the IP address from the UART terminal as shown in Figure 4 and press the **Enter** key.

   **Figure 4. Entering the IPv4 address from the UART terminal**

   ![](images/uart-terminal-ipv4-input.png)

8. From the Python TCP server, send the command to turn the LED ON or OFF to the TCP client ('0' to turn LED OFF and '1' to turn LED ON). Observe the user LED (CYBSP_USER_LED) turning ON/OFF on the board.

   **Figure 5. TCP server output**

   ![](images/tcp-server-output.png)

   <br>

   **Figure 6. LED status on TCP client AP Mode**

   ![](images/tcp-client-ap-post-connection.png)


**Note:** Instead of using the Python TCP server (*tcp_server.py*), you can use the example [mtb-example-anycloud-tcp-server](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/mtb-example-anycloud-tcp-server) to run as TCP server on a second kit. See the code example documentation.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and implementation

### Resources and settings


**Table 1. Application resources**

| Resource  |  Alias/Object     |    Purpose     |
| :------- | :------------    | :------------ |
| SDIO (HAL) | sdio_obj | SDIO interface for Wi-Fi connectivity |
| UART (HAL) |cy_retarget_io_uart_obj| UART HAL object used by Retarget-IO for Debug UART port |
| LED (BSP) | CYBSP_USER_LED | User LED to show the output |

<br>

This example uses the Arm® Cortex®-M4 (CM4) CPU of PSoC 6 MCU to execute an RTOS task: TCP client task. At device reset, the default Cortex-M0+ (CM0+) application enables the CM4 CPU and configures the CM0+ CPU to go to sleep.

In this example, PSoC 6 MCU is configured as a TCP client, which establishes a connection with a remote TCP server and, based on the command received from the TCP server, turns the user LED (CYBSP_USER_LED) ON or OFF.
